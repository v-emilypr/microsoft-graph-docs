# Use the Microsoft Graph compliance and privacy APIs

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft Graph compliance and privacy APIs provide a unified interface and schema to integrate with solutions available in the compliance center from Microsoft and ecosystem partners. This can help customers streamline their compliance and privacy operations to better manage and monitor their data, protect information, minimize insider risk, perform legal and internal investigations, and comply with legal or regulatory standards. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 compliance documentation](/microsoft-365/compliance).

Use the Microsoft Graph compliance and privacy APIs to build applications that:

- Automate common tasks in eDiscovery
- Create and manage subject rights requests

## eDiscovery

eDiscovery in Microsoft 365 provides an end-to-end workflow to preserve, collect, review, analyze, and export data that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations. Learn more about [Microsoft 365 Advanced eDiscovery](/microsoft-365/compliance/overview-ediscovery-20).

Explore the [Microsoft 365 eDiscovery APIs](ediscovery-ediscoveryapioverview.md).

## Subject rights request

Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests provides powerful capabilities to help you handle requests from people seeking to manage their personal data within your organization. These requests are sometimes also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs), data subject access requests (DSARs), or consumer rights requests. Microsoft Priva empowers personnel responsible for fulfilling subject rights requests to easily identify data subjects and find their personal information among your organizationâ€™s data in Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. Learn more about [Priva Subject Rights Requests](/microsoft-365/compliance/privacy-management-subject-rights-requests).
