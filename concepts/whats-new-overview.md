# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

### Identity and access | Directory management
Configure [federation settings](/graph/api/resources/internalDomainFederation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to federate domains with Azure Active Directory.

### Reports | Identity and access reports
Confirm an event is [high-risk and compromised](/graph/api/signin-confirmCompromised?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or is [safe](/graph/api/signin-confirmSafe?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) by marking the event in the corresponding Azure Active Directory sign-in logs.

## March 2022: New and generally available

### Files
Use a [bundle](/graph/api/resources/bundle) resource to share multiple files at once, much like other [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveitem) resources. You can apply CRUD operations on a bundle, and [add](/graph/api/bundle-additem) an item to or [remove](/graph/api/bundle-removeitem) an item from a bundle.

### Identity and access | Directory management
Use [resource-specific permission](/graph/api/resources/resourcespecificpermission) to authorize a Teams app direct access to the data of a specific instance of a chat or team. For example, the resource-specific permission ChannelMessage.Read.Group allows a Teams app to read the channel messages of a single team.

### Identity and access | Governance
- [Get](/graph/api/approval-get) [approval](/graph/api/resources/approval) decisions associated with a [request for access package assignment](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest).
- As part of [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management](/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview), use an [access package assignment policy](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy) to manage a request, approval, assignment, or regular review to an [access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackage). You can govern internal and external users' access to groups, applications, and SharePoint Online sites of an organization.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Specify the [inclusion or exclusion of client applications](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessclientapplications) as among a [set of conditions](/graph/api/resources/conditionalAccessConditionSet) to apply a [conditional access policy](/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy).


## March 2022: New in preview only

### Cloud communications | Online meeting
Specify one or more [meeting participants](/graph/api/resources/meetingParticipants?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) as co-organizer.

### Compliance | eDiscovery
[Purge data](/graph/api/ediscovery-sourcecollection-purgeData?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and permanently delete Microsoft Teams messages from an eDiscovery [source collection](/graph/api/resources/ediscovery-sourcecollection?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Device and app management | Cloud PC
- Use delegated or application permissions of `RoleManagement.Read.CloudPC` for the read operations of the [unifiedRoleDefinition](/graph/api/resources/unifiedroledefinition?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.
- Use delegated or application permissions of `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.CloudPC` for the read and write operations of the [unifiedRoleDefinition](/graph/api/resources/unifiedroledefinition?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.
- Specify the ID and display name of an Azure subscription as part of the information for a [source image for a device](/graph/api/resources/cloudPcSourceDeviceImage?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Device and app management | Corporate management
- Intune March updates for the beta version.

### Device and app management | Multi-tenant management
[List](/graph/api/managedtenants-managedtenant-list-auditevents?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [get](/graph/api/managedtenants-auditevent-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) audit events for managed tenants in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse.

### Identity and access | Directory management
- [List](/graph/api/organizationsettings-list-microsoftapplicationdataaccess?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [update](/graph/api/microsoftapplicationdataaccesssettings-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) [settings](/graph/api/resources/microsoftapplicationdataaccesssettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that specify access from Microsoft applications to Microsoft 365 data belonging to users in an organization. For example, given the proper authorization, whether only Microsoft 365 apps (such as Word and Excel) can access users' Microsoft 365 data, or whether other Microsoft apps (such as Windows) can access the data as well. By default, all users in an organization can access in a Microsoft app any Microsoft 365 data that the user has been authorized to access. 
- Following the Zero Trust cybersecurity model, Microsoft partners can use [granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/graph/api/resources/delegatedadminrelationships-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to carry out administrative tasks with least-privileged access to their customer tenants, to avoid potential security exposures. Instead of requesting Global Administrator role as in the past, partners request specific roles for customer tenant administration for a definite amount of time, and their customers must explicitly grant the least-privileged access to them.

### Security | Attack simulation and training
- [List simulation automations](/graph/api/attacksimulationroot-list-simulationautomations?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for a tenant.
- [List runs](/graph/api/resources/simulationautomationrun?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) of simulation automations for a tenant.

- Qualify a [search query](/graph/api/resources/searchquery?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) string with a template, which supports KQL and query variables.

### Sites and lists
- For a [column](/graph/api/resources/columnDefinition?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that contains taxonomy data, specify the parent [term](/graph/api/resources/termstore-term?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [term set](/graph/api/resources/termstore-set?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for which the child terms can be selected as column values.
- Get the settings for a [site](/graph/api/resources/site?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), including its language and time zone.

### Tasks and plans
Identify if a Planner plan intended for experiences outside of Planner (such as Microsoft Teams) can track work in that context, by checking the **details** relationship of the corresponding  [plannerPlan](/graph/api/resources/plannerPlan?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.

### Teamwork
- Get or set [summary information](/graph/api/resources/teamSummary?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) about a [team](/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), including the count of owners, members, and guests.
- Sort messages in descending order when [listing messages in a chat](/graph/api/chat-list-messages?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).


## Want to stay in the loop?

Here are some ways we can engage:

- Are there scenarios you'd like Microsoft Graph to support? Suggest and vote for new features at [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-developer-platform/idb-p/Microsoft365DeveloperPlatform/label-name/Microsoft%20Graph).
    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`).
